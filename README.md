# PongC++ (Raylib)

## Learning Raylib Library and C++ by remaking the classic game Pong!

In my attempted to deepen my C++ knowledge and one step forward to my Game Development career, I recreate the classic game Pong with the help of OpenGL library Raylib. Here are the things I learned: 

* Taking advantage of the Raylib library to use the graphic unit
* Practical uses of Object-Orientated Programing in C++ 
* Creating simple computer AI
* Working with C++
